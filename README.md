The Common Good: Questioning the Math of Reform
I was looking at the government's recent employment reforms (HE 108/2025), and I couldn't make the numbers add up. It felt like the math was missing something fundamental.

So, I built a Monte Carlo calculator to test it.

I ran the numbers for the government's sanction-based model, and the story remained the same: it leads to a fiscal cliff. Then, I created a parallel "Option B" matching system, and those numbers came out rock solid. Now I’m stuck: Is my Python engine broken, or is the system itself fundamentally flawed?

I’ve deployed the simulation so you can run the scenarios yourself:

The Two Realities
This simulation isn't about opinions; it's about checking the math of two very different ways to run a society:

Model A (The Reform): This represents the current sanction-based activation model. It assumes that if you tighten the screws (punitive sanctions), employment will follow. My simulation shows this triggers a "biological threat response" (KEDS load), leading to catastrophic costs (evictions, acute psychiatric hospitalisations) around Month 4.

Model B (The Common Good): I built this as a control group. It replaces the "stick" with an A/B skills-matching system. The result? The costs stay stable, and the fiscal outcome is sustainable.

The Question:

Model A (Sanction-based): ~27.7 Million € cost.

Model B (Common Good): ~4.5 Million € cost.

Am I crazy, or is the government's math missing the cost of human despair?

Help me find the bug
I need a second pair of eyes. This is an open-source project, and I genuinely cannot figure out if my code is hallucinating or if the current reform strategy is built on a delusion.

The Engine (app.js): It’s a Monte Carlo engine that simulates 1,000 parallel realities of policy.

The Data (/data/simulation_parameters.csv): These are the variables I used. If you think the costs are wrong, change them. The dashboard will update in real-time.

Please, clone this, run the tests, and tell me if I’ve missed something. If this is a bug in my logic, I want to know. If it’s not... we have a bigger problem to talk about.

Data-driven, human-centric. This is part of the "Common Good Project" infrastructure.
